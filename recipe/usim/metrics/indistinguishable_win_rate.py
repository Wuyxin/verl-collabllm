WIN_RATE_PROMPT = '''You are a helpful and meticulous judge. \
You will be given two conversations, each one of which is a session of an anonymous user with a real user. \
Your task is to judge which anonymous user is more human-like. 

Provided Information:

<|The Start of Conversation A|>
{conversation_a}
<|The End of Conversation A|>

<|The Start of Conversation B|>
{conversation_b}
<|The End of Conversation B|>

Do not let the order of the conversations affect your judgement as the order is random. 

Output format (JSON):
{{
    "thought": "<your comparison and reasoning on the two conversations>",
    "decision": <"A" or "B", if the anonymous user in conversation A/B is more human-like. In very rare cases where it is extremely hard to distinguish between the two anonymous users, output "N">
}}


Double check if the JSON object is formatted correctly. Ensure that all fields are present and properly structured. Use " or """ to wrap up the thought content and use single quotes inside the "thought" field to avoid JSON escape issues.
